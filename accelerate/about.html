	<h1>About Us</h1>

	<h2>Our Mission</h2>

	<p>
		To foster a richer and diverse startup ecosystem by leading early-stage investment in mobile-first female-led startup ventures.

		Women Innovate Mobile (WIM) is the first startup accelerator to focus its investment strategy on mobile-first female led startup ventures. Female founded startups typically receive less VC funding – and we see that as an investment opportunity. It is also our deep belief that more women entrepreneurs in tech creates a richer and more diverse innovation ecosystem.
 
		WIM is a mentorship-driven accelerator. Startups accelerate their growth through seed funding, business support (office space, product development and design support, mobile-marketing promotions), and access to our network of mentors, funders and advisors. In exchange for our investment and services, WIM receives an equity stake in each company.

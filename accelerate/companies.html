		<p>Appguppy is the easiest way to go mobile.

Appguppy leverages innovations in HTML5 technology to let anyone turn themselves into an app in 5 minutes and distribute to fans, followers and friends on social media and through email. Founded in 2011, Appguppy has over a thousand customers across Asia, Europe and North America since its beta launch in early July of 2012.</p>

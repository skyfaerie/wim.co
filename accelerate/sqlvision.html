Data professionals use the SQL Vision platform to manage and derive value from data, regardless of data volume or where it is stored, without the need for additional resources or hardware. SQL Vision utilizes a cloud-based architecture and Big Data Analytics to enable companies to solve database management problems, facilitate capacity planning and generate value from their data. Founded by a team with significant background in database management, SQL Vision addresses a critical problem that impacts mid-tier companies as well as larger enterprises. SQL Vision is currently in closed private beta.</p>

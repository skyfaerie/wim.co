<p>Appguppy is the easiest way to go mobile. It’s a technology that democratizes app development by letting the “little guy,” the non-coder with a small budget, make and share a customized mobile app that works on all iOS and Android phones and does not require app stores. Appguppy leverages innovations in HTML5 technology to let anyone turn themselves into an app in 5 minutes and distribute to fans, followers and friends on social media and through email. Founded in 2011, Appguppy has over a thousand customers across Asia, Europe and North America since its beta launch in early July of 2012.</p>

	<h1>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:</h1>

	<h4>How long is your program?</h4>
	<p>6 months.</p>
	 
	<h4>6 months?  That is a mighty long time for an Accelerator Program.</h4>
	<p>Yes it is. We take our investments very seriously and we are devoted to providing a custom accelerator experience. Here is a brief overview of what those 6 months look like:</p>
	 
	<ul> 
		<li><p>Month 1 (Due diligence): During Month 1 we work with each team to perform financial and legal due diligence.  Additionally, we use this month to take a deep dive into each company to understand what they will need most during the accelerator period so we can curate where they accelerate, which active mentor they should be paired with, which Founder at WIM they will work with, and what custom curriculum is necessary for success.  Prior Planning Prevents Poor Performance—we are all about reducing any friction throughout the acceleration period!</p></li>

		<li><p>Month 2-5 (Acceleration):  During this time period we roll up our sleeves to accelerate each company.  We do this through direct work with mentors, WIM Founders, and via a custom curriculum that is specific to our class cohort.  We provide additional roundtable programming for CEOs to assist in their development as Executives.</p></li>

		<li><p>Month 6 (Strategic Planning and Off-boarding): After the acceleration period is complete we take a final month to perform another round of due diligence.  That includes working with each company one on one to help them plan out their goals and objectives over the next 6 months-1 year.</p></li>
	 </ul>
	
	<h4>So what happens when the accelerator ends?</h4>
	 
	<p>We are an accelerator with a “VC mindset.” so even when companies complete the program they are still a part of the WIM network.  Our CEO, for example, checks in regularly with our initial class.  We run a tight ship so we can keep our portfolio companies integrated and in the loop.</p>
	 
	<h4>HOW DO I APPLY?</h4>
	<p>Simply fill out our online application.</p>
	 
	<h4>DO I NEED TO HAVE A BUSINESS PLAN?</h4>	

	<p>We’re more concerned about your business model than a formal business plan (to quote Steve Blank -  “A business model describes how your company creates, delivers and captures value“). We do ask for a deck because we want to know that you’ve thought through your business in terms of what problem you’re trying to solve, the size of the market, how you’re going to generate revenue, your competitive differentiation, etc.

	<h4>HOW MUCH DOES WOMEN INNOVATE MOBILE INVEST IN EACH COMPANY? WHAT PERCENTAGE OF EQUITY DOES WOMEN INNOVATE MOBILE RECEIVE IN RETURN?</h4>
	
	<p>Women Innovate Mobile will be investing $40,000 in each company selected for the accelerator. However, it’s not just the money. We’re investing other valuable resources in future success of your company: feedback and guidance from mentors and advisors, curated curriculum based on your needs, and design and development services from our service providers.

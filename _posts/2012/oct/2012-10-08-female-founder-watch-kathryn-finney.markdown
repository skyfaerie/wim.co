__Kathryn Finney__

_Founder & Blogger_

_Digitalundivided/ The Budget Fashionista_

__Who inspires you?__

Harlem. My community is so vibrant, so interesting, so loud, so hard, that I learn something new everyday.

__Why are you an entrepreneur?__

I like to run things.

__Where do you see your company in the next five years?__

I definitely see TBF Group being a part of a larger content network. In terms of digitalundivided (www.digitalundivided.com), I hope we’re SO successful with our  goal to get the black community involved in the new tech economy, that we can shut our doors.

__How is your company different from your competitors?__

I am a member of the group that we’re trying to impact, so I understand (and have lived) the challenges many face in trying to navigate this tech world.

__What was a defining moment in your career?__

The first time I was on the TODAY Show. I was like “am I really here?”. “Oh my, Ann Curry is interviewing ME”.

__What is your next step with your company, your career?__

I really enjoy the work we’re doing with digitalundivided and next we have a series of nationwide workshops to bring silicon valley/alley to communities across the country.

__How did you finance your business when it was at the early stage? (Self-funded, crowd-funded, Angel Investor, VC)__

Everything I do is self-funded, mostly because I like to focus on building things, rather than raising money.

__Tell me something about yourself that we don’t know already.__

I played Rugby for 7 years, 4 years in college, 2 years in grad school, and 1 year with Philadelphia Women’s club.

__What is your guilty pleasure? (Real Housewives, Chocolate, 50 shades of Grey, etc)__

There is nothing I enjoy more  than reading super trashy British celebrity magazines like Hello and Ok. The photo shoots in those magazines are better than Monty Python when it comes to British comedy.

__If you had one year that you could say was the best year of your life what year would it be? Why? How old were you?__

I think any year you’re alive and well and everyone you love is alive and well is a very good year.

__Describe a time you failed. What did you learn from that experience?__

I guess I don’t look at things as failures, so much as learning experiences. So it’s hard to look back at something and say “oh, no, I failed”.  My biggest learning experiences all involved a time when I wasn’t being true to myself.

__What do you do fun?__

I love to travel, so my husband and I go on a big trip every year (this year was Alaska).  I also like to swim, I swim about 4 to 5 times per week.

__Do you have a hidden talent?__

I sew, not as much as I did growing up, but I do like to sew.

__What is your favorite mobile app?__

I have a blackberry that is my heart and soul, which means I don’t have access to any cool apps.  But I do like to play words with friends on my husband’s iPhone.

__What do you do to help focus?__

I swim. I’m practicing for my lifeguard certificate.

__Cool Kid or Nerd in High school?__

Can I be a cool nerd? I was my class president, national honor society and played sports. I was basically everywhere and my parents have the battle scars to prove it.

__Any words of advice for up & coming entrepreneurs who are trying to get their products noticed?__

BE. YOURSELF. I can’t stress this enough. Being an entrepreneur isn’t a race, but a marathon and it’s so much easier to compete if you just be yourself. Also, learn to say No.

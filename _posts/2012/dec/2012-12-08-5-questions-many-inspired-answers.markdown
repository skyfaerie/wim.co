__Q:  What’s your resolution(s) for 2013?__

I don’t normally make resolutions, but if I had to make one this year it would be to stop worrying about being good enough and just be myself. – Ebony Rentas, CEO and Founder, The Women’s Age @TheWomensAge

To dedicate some time every day to aggressively pursuing business development opportunities. For me this is crucial because being a student at Stanford makes develop my business much harder. So I want to dedicate X time daily to actively working, not just answering email/doing busy work. On this note, I want to reach out to at least one new person in a different field every week to learn as much as I can, get my name and brand out there, and push myself out of my comfort zone. – Julia Landauer, NASCAR driver &amp; student at Stanford @julialandauer

Worry less, play more. - Melissa Clark-Reynolds,[www.minimonos.com](http://www.minimonos.com/) Alpha Monkey &amp; CEO @maximonos

Stop asking if I’m “the expert” and just get out there and be part of the conversation. – Alexis Finch, GraphiteMind.com @agentfin

My resolution for 2013 is to schedule better. I need to set aside time for routine tasks that too often fall behind. It’s too easy to focus on the big issue of the week and forget about small tasks that add big value. - Tom Weingarten, Co-founder &amp; CTO, Delve, @tomweingarten


__Q:  Entrepreneurial discovery of 2012?__

Accelerator/Incubator programs. Prior to learning of Women Innovate Mobile/IncubateNYC, I thought that the only way to build a business was to have a business background and secure financing from a bank.  – Ebony Rentas, CEO and Founder, The Women’s Age @TheWomensAge

Ocado on my ipad.  I am bored senseless by shopping.  Love putting boring household stuff on my shopping list when I remember it and having it magically delivered. - Melissa Clark-Reynolds, [www.minimonos.com](www.minimonos.com) Alpha Monkey &amp; CEO @maximonos

Uber – Carrie Hammer, Founder [http://www.carriehammer.com/](http://www.carriehammer.com/) @carrierhammer

Google Analytics—-everyone should track their website with it! - Jennifer Markas, Founder, Damsels in Design @damselsindesign

Trello maybe, but it still doesn’t solve all my list problems! The search goes on. - Ellen Dudley, Founder peoplehunt.me @meetforeal

For me it has been to realize how big the entrepreneurship community is in NYC (rivaling the west coast) and how many angels / accelerators / advisors are out there, willing to listen to you. – Ricardo Cuervo, Founder, Best Fashion Friend @BFFapp

Goodreads is the best website for bookworms (ME!) out there. I can’t believe only the NYT best selling list existed before this. AirBnB’s design principals - continuously amazing, even if I didn’t have their equity. No matter how much you believe in your idea, doubt is a constant companion…and that’s OK. Anyone who says that, as an entrepreneur, you must/will/should BLINDLY believe in your idea always and always is an ass-donkey. Entrepreneurs are human and humans have doubt. Simple as that. – Diana Sonis, Founder, BuzzTarget @DianaSonis

TONS !!! - Guillaume Gauthereau, Founder, SequoiaLab.com Totsy.com @ggauthereau

Looking back at 2012, it has been an exciting and exceptional year for the world where mobility + commerce + content are unlocking the expansion and globalization of a new middle class.  We are experiencing what happens when the entire world has access to education and technology.  Third world countries will have opportunity to grow at unprecedented paces.  It will be interesting to look back on 2013 and see just how connected the world will be. - Kelly Stickel, Founder and President of Remodista @kstickel @bricksandmobile @mobile4mommies

StackOverflow. It ain’t what you know, it’s how well you can describe the parameters of the gap you need filled. – Alexis Finch, GraphiteMind.com @agentfin

We’ve been using podio to keep our team informed and it’s been a big help.  - Tom Weingarten, Co-founder &amp; CTO, Delve, @tomweingarten


__Q:  Doh?!!! moment of the last 12 months?__

I had no clue that aging was such a dirty word. When I first started working on The Women’s Age I sincerely and naively thought that there were a plethora of women out in the world who would want to join me in celebrating aging. Nope, not the case, but that will change soon. – Ebony Rentas, CEO and Founder, The Women’s Age @TheWomensAge

Not sure I had one - or if I did and it was so obvious it’s left me  - Beth Temple, Digital Pioneer @bethtemple4u

Tablets have taken over in the kids space, and watching on-demand is now more influential that broadcast for UK kids. - Melissa Clark-Reynolds, [www.minimonos.com](www.minimonos.com) Alpha Monkey &amp; CEO @maximonos

Wearing the same outfit every day – Carrie Hammer, Founder[http://www.carriehammer.com/](http://www.carriehammer.com/) @carrierhammer

It can be too easy to make small iterations on a product/service that isn’t built to scale. Do your experiments. Get your data. Sometimes you need rebuild things. Don’t put it off. You should be working on the hardest problems. - Ellen Dudley, Founder peoplehunt.me @meetforeal

“it is the User Experience, Stupid” – Ricardo Cuervo, Founder, Best Fashion Friend @BFFapp

You can push new features/design of your own website live…only to figure out a day later that perhaps you got over-excited on the features and some of it could have waited (mildly put).  Looking at your website and hating it’s color scheme, then feeling silly for hating it because there are more important things to get done, but then…..”what WAS I thinking?!” Some of your “target” market will think you’re not cool and it hurts and you go “Doh?!!”….and that’s OK.  – Diana Sonis, Founder, BuzzTarget @DianaSonis

The biggest idea I have is around onlyness. It’s become so clear that I need to write more on this. – Nilofer Merchant, The Jane Bond of Innovation, @nilofer

Shift in the VC market investment cycle. - Guillaume Gauthereau, Founder, SequoiaLab.com Totsy.com @ggauthereau

Have a plan, work the plan. – Caroline Van Sickle, Founder, Pretty in My Pocket @prettyinmypoc

Previously, I was building a B2C company that improved the shopping experience with the long-term vision that the core value proposition would be to extract merchandising insights from consumer preference data - a B2B solution. This summer, I took a step back and figured out a smarter way to execute against my long-term vision today.  If I focused on solving the core value proposition first, I might have come to my current solution and recruited the right team faster.  In conclusion, I was constrained by what I thought was possible and didn’t seek solutions that were not so obvious. – Karen Moon Co-Founder &amp; CEO, StyleMusée @stylemusee

The importance of content! - Sureena Taparia, Founder &amp; CEO, Fifth Bond @fifthbond

It’s not about the idea, it’s the people you’ll be working with, the people you have to trust to throw down everything you’ve got and that they’ve got, to build something. Anything less will fail. ] – Alexis Finch, GraphiteMind.com @agentfin

Countless little DOH moments but no big one that stands out (thankfully!) - Tom Weingarten, Co-founder &amp; CTO, Delve, @tomweingarten


__Q:  What’s on your mobile wish list?__

iPad or Windows tablet . – Ebony Rentas, CEO and Founder, The Women’s Age @TheWomensAge

This proves my point that you can’t ask customers what they want, they don’t know - I’ll know it when I see it! – Beth Temple, Digital Pioneer @bethtemple4u

I’d love an iPad, especially to be able to meet people, and if they show interest, immediately allow them to “like” my Facebook page and follow me on Twitter. I think marketing can be done so much more easily on an iPad than schlepping around a laptop. - – Julia Landauer, NASCAR driver &amp; student at Stanford @julialandauer

3D printing apps. - Melissa Clark-Reynolds, [www.minimonos.com](www.minimonos.com) Alpha Monkey &amp; CEO @maximonos

Mobile wish list would have to be my own wearhou.se… - Jaclyn Siu, Founder, Wearhou.se @jaclynsiu | @wearhouse

A home heel repair device – Carrie Hammer, Founder [http://www.carriehammer.com/](http://www.carriehammer.com/)@carrierhammer

Nexus Android phone… iPad mini and more speaking engagements - Sian Morson  Founder/CEO Kollective Mobile @kollectivemobil

Not for certain if this exists, but I would love if there were a mobile app that told me all of the event spaces in NYC by cost, size, etc. It would help with event planning a ton! - Jennifer Markas, Founder, Damsels in Design @damselsindesign

Our rebuild of PeopleHunt, early release coming out January. Very excited! - Ellen Dudley, Founder peoplehunt.me @meetforeal

A standardized android platform! – Ricardo Cuervo, Founder, Best Fashion Friend @BFFapp

I want google maps back on the iphone in its previous (native) form. I need the subway info! A good networking app that would connect relevant people one-on-one would be nice. LinkedIn is OK, but something that is local and lets me connect in person.  A game that lets me discover my physical surroundings…kind of like FieldTrip but for iphone. – Diana Sonis, Founder, BuzzTarget @DianaSonis

Instapaper PLEX  My W Days  LogMeIn - Guillaume Gauthereau, Founder, SequoiaLab.com Totsy.com @ggauthereau

iPad mini. – Caroline Van Sickle, Founder, Pretty in My Pocket @prettyinmypoc

Please please PLEASE let me control who calls me better? It should be up to the caller to decide if they REALLY need to interrupt what I’m up to. ] – Alexis Finch, GraphiteMind.com @agentfin

My #1 request for phones has been and continues to be that I wish they were better for actually calling people. It seems like a no-brainer but it’s been years since I owned a phone that actually did that well. Slightly more ambitiously, I’d like a mobile device that nails run tracking. There’s a few that come close but so far no one’s really gotten it quite right yet. - Tom Weingarten, Co-founder &amp; CTO, Delve, @tomweingarten

Being invited to breakfast by designer, Kay Unger to chat about DID. She is one of the most inspiring, dedicated, and passionate women I know. - Jennifer Markas, Founder, Damsels in Design @damselsindesign

Every moment that I realize I’m still working on what I’m passionate about. I’m super grateful to have such wonderful people in my life to support me in this startup life. (You would never know I’m Irish from that statement). - Ellen Dudley, Founder peoplehunt.me @meetforeal

Having created, funded, developed and grown an innovative fashion styling and social networking platform - this puts us in a great position with 2013 and to adjust our business plan to reflect the interests and wishes of the BFF community, as we are deciding how to best open the platform to designers, retailers, brands and content providers (OK - I know it sounds like self-promotion, but it has been a long Yes!! to us @BFF). – Ricardo Cuervo, Founder, Best Fashion Friend @BFFapp

Selling NabeWise. Working with my husband on a startup and making both sides of the equation actually work…that’s a startup within a startup. Taking a trip on my own (NZ/AU) and LOVING IT! – Diana Sonis, Founder, BuzzTarget @DianaSonis

To see #SocialEra get recognized as a Fast Company book of the year. This is the same book that many influential people all said didn’t need to be…a sign to me (and hopefully to others) to pursue the idea that won’t let you go, not the most popular idea. Honestly, we need to chase our passions without regard of what other people think. – Nilofer Merchant, The Jane Bond of Innovation, @nilofer

Getting up on stage and teaching a few hundred people how to draw dinosaurs as part of my talk on why visual thinking is so key to understanding complex ideas (memory <=> emotion) – Alexis Finch, GraphiteMind.com @agentfin

__Q: Who inspires you?__

A: I always struggle with this question, as there isn’t really anyone well known who springs to mind. I am often inspired by the incredible people that I meet on a day-to-day basis. I learn a lot from people-watching!


__Q: Why are you an entrepreneur? __

A: I like marching to my own beat and I find solving problems completely absorbing.


__Q: What was a defining moment in your career?__

A: Having to take 3 months off work due to stress &amp; exhaustion. It was the wake up call I needed to make a big change and break out on my own.


__Q: How is your company different from your competitors?__

A: Our purpose: We focus on providing value to local service providers rather than traditional lead-gen businesses of old. We do this by giving them a simple online business platform through which to manage their business. [www.teddle.com](http://www.teddle.com/) as well as helping them grow their business through our marketing.


__Q: Where do you see your company in the next five years?__

A: As a hub of local community – like the local coffee shop but online.


__Q: What’s next for your company?__

A: Focus on user experience on both sides of our marketplace.


__Q: How did you finance your business when it was at the early stage? (Self-funded, crowd-funded, Angel Investor, VC)__

A: Self-funded and then seed investment from an incubator.


__Q: Tell me something about yourself that we don’t know already.__

A: I worked on Obama’s campaign for Illinois Senate.


__Q: What is your guilty pleasure?__

A: An empty house, bottle of white wine, Chinese and US dramas like The Good Wife.


__Q: Describe a time you failed. What did you learn from that experience?__

A: I repeatedly failed to get into the MI5! I learnt that you need to be suited to your job i.e. if it calls for discretion, its probably best you are not loud and opinionated!


__Q: What is your favourite mobile app?__

A: I think I am rather boring as it would either be a travel app like National Rail so I can get real-time train times or Pulse, all my news in one place!


__Q: What do you do to help focus?__

A: Get on a train – it’s where I write and do my best thinking, as I can’t be distracted. There is something soothing about motion!


__Q: Any words of advice for entrepreneurs who are trying to get their ventures launched?__

A: Think small. Of course it has to have potential but so many people start far too big and fail to get it working. Solve a tiny problem and it is bound to grow. Oh and don’t build for VCs.

Laura Zapata is a freelance digital strategist, contributor to Open Source Fashion Magazine, the founder and editor of [Fashion Digital Daily](http://fashiondigitaldaily.com/) and the Co-Founder of The Future of Fashion Series.

 

__Q: Who inspires you?__

A: Incredibly creative and passionate people that are unbelievably talented at what they do: Sally Singer, Joe Zee, Katie Grand, Joanne Blades and Victoria Bartlett…

 

__Q: Why are you an entrepreneur?__

A: My partner and I discussed ideas over drinks, agreed to take a chance on The Future of Fashion Series, and next thing you know, we had a business on our hands. As for my blog, I had loads of research on fashion startups and needed a place to quickly reference that information. I thought, why not share this information with others? When the Google Analytics were showing return visitors from all over the world, it motivated me to post as much as I could and build out the Fashion Digital Daily brand. Let’s be honest, the entrepreneurial spirit in New York is infectious.

 

__Q: What was a defining moment in your career?__

A: When I was hired as the senior style advisor for the brand Topshop. I beat out hundreds of applicants for the job and it was the first time I was asked to oversee an entire team. My interview process took weeks and even included fashion challenges! It was a huge leap in my career and I was so excited to be part of a brand that people were so infatuated with. My role was the only of its kind in the US, so needless to say, there was huge pressure to succeed; but it also lent to amazing opportunities because we were still defining my role as we went along. The week of the SoHo flagship launch, I met Kate Moss, I presented the collections to Anna Wintour on a private tour and our team was featured in The New York Times — it was a truly surreal experience.

 

__Q: How is your company different from your competitors?__

A: Other people in the space are focused on networking events and panel discussions. What The Future of Fashion Series is interested in, is showcasing innovative startups and introducing those businesses to highly influential, industry experts. We’re trying to create genuine business connections in a high impact setting that’s exciting for everyone involved, including the audience. We’re not your average tech event veiled as a fashion meetup — we’re fashion professionals talking innovation and smart business.

 

__Q: Where do you see your company in the next five years?__

A: Partnering with big brands, scaling the business model, hiring staff and a sea of interns!

 

__Q: What’s next for your company?__

A: We’re building a Future of Fashion website now, scouting for the 2013 roster and meeting with brands on strategic partnerships.

 

__Q: How did you finance your business when it was at the early stage? (Self-funded, crowd-funded, Angel Investor, VC)__

A: Currently, we still are early stage! It’s a mix of self-funding, crowd-funding and corporate sponsorships.

 

__Q: Tell me something about yourself that we don’t know already.__

A: My Mom enrolled me in a ballet folklorico dance troupe when I was very young. Ballet folklorico is a type of dance that reflects various regions in Mexico. The dance movements are a mix of tap and ballet and are performed in traditional Mexican costumes. My first theatre performance was center stage at age 6 (to the Mexican Hat Dance), and I continued performing with the troupe through my teens. My love of dancing continues to this day, and I’m comfortable doing anything from hip-hop, country dancing, salsa, merengue, vogueing…you name it. I’m a blast at holiday parties!

 

__Q: What is your guilty pleasure?__

A: Movies where there’s a dramatic, choreographed dance finale. ’Flashdance’, ‘Center Stage’, ‘Paris is Burning’, ‘Dirty Dancing’, even ‘Bring It On’!

 

__Q: Describe a time you failed. What did you learn from that experience?__

A: I let myself become completely consumed and defined by my job. I was living to work, not working to live. My employer totally took advantage and I would be called in on days off, weekends and major holidays. Then one day I realized it was because I let them treat me that way. I learned that it was OK to say no and how important it was to prioritize ‘me’ time.

 

__Q: What is your favorite mobile app?__

A: Instagram, hands down. I love that there’s little to no interaction needed and that I can live vicariously through people’s travel photos.

 

__Q: What do you do to help focus?__

A: I need silence. Although, this is incredibly hard in New York, so I had to learn how to meditate. Sometimes I wear headphones and people  think I’m listening to music, but there’s nothing playing on the other end. A high intensity cardio workout always helps, and if I have a lot of copywriting to do, I MUST have a coffee and/or a RedBull at my side.

 

__Q: Favorite fashion trend?__

A: Structual shapes and design in accessories.

 

__Q: Which #fashiontech start-ups should we be watching?__

A: Keep your eye on Perch, Holition, Little Black Bag, Fashion Qlic, Bespoke Post, Everlane and Fohr Card. For even more recommendations, check out FashionDigitalDaily.com! We report on the best services, sites, campaigns and apps in the fashion startup space.

 

__Q: Any words of advice for entrepreneurs who are trying to get their ventures launched?__

A: Stay passionate by keeping company with positive-minded entrepreneurs, find a method that keeps you focused and stick with it, have a smart mentor that isn’t financially invested in your company (they’ll be your unbiased touchstone), and be social in multiple New York scenes).

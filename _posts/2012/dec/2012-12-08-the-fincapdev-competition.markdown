FinCapDev proposals are due at 6:00 PM ET on **Monday, December 10, 2012**! That’s just three days! Three days for you not only to build the next great personal finance app with the support of numerous resources, but also to take a shot at the $50,000 Grand Prize!


__*So what is FinCapDev?*__ It’s a nationwide challenge to develop new mobile apps that will help working Americans make smart financial choices and get better access to financial services.


In addition to bringing to millions a handful of new, fully functioning apps to market, the goal of FinCapDev is to cultivate an ecosystem of American innovators, software developers, financial service firms, investors, and nonprofits innovating new mobile tools to help consumers control and shape their financial futures that improve the ability of working Americans to make smart financial choices and/or provide better access to financial services


Who is supporting the next personal finance app? Braintree is offering two finalists access to its payment gateway by waiving fees, essentially giving finalists their first $10,000 dollars in processing for free, along with covering all related interchange costs. EachScape is providing selected FinCapDev finalists access to their drag and drop platform to build their mobile apps and expert mentorship. And don’t forget resources offered by partners Citi, Dell Social Innovation Challenge, Facebook, H&amp;R Block, ideas42, MasterCard, Women Innovate Mobile, and Yodlee; and financial supporters the Ford Foundation, the Citi Foundation, and Omidyar Network.

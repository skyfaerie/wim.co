*“Our challenge is to leverage the power of technology and bridge the digital divide. We need to do more to help all children and young people make the most of the opportunities provided by information and communications technology – especially all those who are still unconnected from the digital revolution.”  - UN Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon*


Agnite Education, American Digital University, Applications for Good, BluWorld, Datawind, Equal Access International and the United Nations Office for Partnerships are pleased to announce the Global Apps to Empower competition to challenge apps developers to create apps that empower all young women in leadership and mentorship, jobs and entrepreneurship, education and conflict resolution.
Applications that best satisfy the competition criteria will receive cash prizes and the opportunity to have their apps featured on Datawind’s Ubislate educational tablet.
Datawind CEO Suneet Tuli said, *“Our goal is to feature apps on our tablets for young women in developing countries who seek to become leaders in their communities; to be mentored by some of the best leaders currently in business and government; to learn how to start businesses; find meaningful work; and gain a practical skill that can improve not only her life but the lives of those in her community.”*

 
The competition will be held from now through April 30th, 2013 with the winners announced in July 2013.  An esteemed panel of judges includes, among others:

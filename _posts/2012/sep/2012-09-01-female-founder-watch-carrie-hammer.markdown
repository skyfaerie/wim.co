__Carrie Hammer__

_Founder_

_CARRIE HAMMER Custom Apparel_

__Who inspires you?__

My mother- she excels at everything she does. She is queen of the boardroom, queen of the household, queen of philanthropy—you get it. She takes on a realm or a project and takes it to new heights.

__Why have you decided to become an entrepreneur?__

It was modeled to me by my entrepreneurial parents, so partly it’s in my blood and partly I see so many opportunities and inefficiencies in the world and am excited about working on them.

__Where do you see your company in the next five years?__

I’m looking to build CARRIE HAMMER out into a multi channel and multi vertical brand to help professional women and women in general in many different ways. I’m very excited about the future!

__How is your company different from other Professional Women’s Apparel companies?__

CARRIE HAMMER custom apparel is an online and by appointment line for professional women. We differentiate ourselves by putting an emphasis on style and fit by 100% custom tailoring our clothes to our customers.

__What was a defining moment in your career?__

Leaving my job in advertising sales to start my own company. Advertising was interesting and fast paced but it wasn’t my true calling. It was a big jump and a leap of faith to switch careers but it was one that was necessary both my career and life.

__What is your next step within your career?__

The next step is growing CARRIE HAMMER at a steady yet rapid pace to be able to outfit as many women who need and want custom clothing as possible. Taking the leap from start up to full fledged company

__How did you finance your business when it was at the early stage? (Self-funded, crowd-funded, Angel Investor, VC)__

When I was in advertising sales I knew I eventually wanted to start my own company. For 4 years I saved every single commission check in anticipation of eventually needing to fund my business. With that savings I was able to get myself up and going and sales have kept CARRIE HAMMER running.

__Tell me something about yourself that we don’t know already.__

I want to be a pilot. I have taken flying lessons and love to be in the sky!

__What is your favorite color?__

Can’t just have one – that’s not fair. I have favorites for different categories: Bright Teal Blue (to wear), Black/White (for home), Cotton Candy Pink (overall)

__What is your guilty pleasure? (Real Housewives, Chocolate, 50 shades of Grey, etc)__

Craft Time—sitting around with a glue gun, swarovski crystals, stamps, glitter, etc. That couldn’t make me happier.

__Who is your celebrity crush?__

Pete Cashmore – Founder of Mashable (swoon!)

__How do you define success?__

Being satisfied every day with where you are, who you are, and what you stand for.

__If you had one year that you could say was the best year of your life what year would it be? Why? How old were you?__

I hear life gets better every single year so I guess the best year of my life will be my last year. Not sure when that will be but I hope it’s far away!

__Describe a time you failed. What did you learn from that experience?__

I fail (and succeed) every single day. The severity of the failures vary by day (I forgot to send that e-mail vs. I’m not at my sales goals. I betrayed trust). The biggest failure is not being able to bounce back from the low.

__What do you do for fun?__

I love all sorts of different art. My mom’s an artist and a big influence in my life and work. I love photography, painting, drawing, water color, collage… really anything I can get my hands on!

__Do you have a hidden talent?__

I give very thoughtful gifts. I often buy them even when there isn’t an event or birthday nearby. I pick things up as they remind me of people and stash them away.

__What is your favorite mobile app?__

Pandora

__What do you do to help focus?__

Meditate every morning for 20 minutes

__Cool Kid or Nerd in High school?__

Cool Nerd—I was the homecoming queen who won the math award

__What is your favorite style trend for the fall?__

I try not to follow trends too closely. I find staying true to personal style always suites everyone the best. That being said, I always love a good leather accent.

__Any words of advice for up & coming designers who are trying to get their brands noticed?__

Be your own number one fan and salesperson. Go to every event and wear your brand everywhere! My friends make fun of me and they call my line my “uniform” since I wear it every single day. Repetition is an important part of branding and you never know who you might run into so you better be wearing your elevator pitch!

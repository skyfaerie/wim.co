__Catherine Levene__

_CEO and Co-Founder_

_ArtSpace_

__Who inspires you?__

Anyone who creates. Artists, writers, filmmakers, fashion designers, engineers, entrepreneurs.

__Why have you decided to become an entrepreneur?__

I have always loved the process of creating and had the entrepreneurial spirit. But I wouldn’t be an entrepreneur just for the sake of it. We had a great idea, in an area of personal passion. The art market hadn’t yet been transformed by internet distribution so it was a wide open space with a huge market opportunity. And I had a business partner that perfectly complimented my own skill. I guess the stars were aligned.

__Where do you see your company in the next five years?__

As the clear leader in the exploding online marketplace for fine art with a growing, thriving and profitable business.

__How is your company different from other online art companies?__

We are the only website where you can put your credit card in and a buy work from world renowned artists of this caliber from across the globe.

__What was a defining moment in your career?__

A defining moment is difficult to pinpoint. I’ve had lots of great learning experiences and I still am learning every day.

__How did you finance your business when it was at the early stage? (Self-funded, crowd-funded, Angel Investor, VC)__

We got seed funding from a number of really supportive individual and institutional investors.

__What is your favorite color?__

For clothing, black. Otherwise, red.

__How do you define success?__

Being happy in my career and personal life at the same time.

__What do you for fun?__

Travel and spend time with friends, family and my dog. Go to art exhibits, movies, and the theatre. Play tennis. I also love spending time on the water as well.

__What is your favorite mobile app?__

Right now, Spotify.

__What do you do to help focus?__

It’s hard to stay focused if you’re not eating right or exercising, so I start there. Then I set very clear goals for what I want to accomplish in a specific day or period of time and try my hardest to stick with it.

__Cool Kid or Nerd in High school?__

I suppose I was a cool kid.

__What is your favorite style trend this fall?__

I love that leather is back. Also, I am into bohemian chic, which I feel is always in style.

Catherine’s interview was conducted by WIM intern, [Jadine Joseph][jadine]

__Jessica Finkelstein__

_JD, CIPP_

_Attorney Specializing in Digital Media, Ad Tech, Privacy & Internet Law_

__Who inspires you?__

My dad.  As a son of holocaust survivors, he came to the United States as a child, learned English, studied hard, persevered, and went from rocket scientist to music executive.  He’s not just my dad; he’s by far the most interesting person I know.

__Why have you decided to become an entrepreneur?__

After years at large firms/large companies, I was frustrated with the pace of getting things done. I’m better suited for the “make a decision on the spot and execute,” the mentality of most entrepreneurs.

__What was a defining moment in your career?__

My defining moment was leaving my law firm and going in-house at AOL.  Although I didn’t know it at the time, being part of the advertising and internet space in 2005 led me to becoming General Counsel of Admeld, which in turn has led me to many opportunities within the now booming NYC ad-tech scene.

__What is your next step within your career?__

I’m not quite sure.  I’m currently consulting for a few ad-tech startups, and I don’t know if I will continue on my own or go back to being General Counsel of another company.

__Tell me something about yourself that we don’t know already__

I was a mathlete in high school.

__What is your favorite color?__
Black – the chic one, not the morbid one.

__What is your guilty pleasure? (Real Housewives, Chocolate, 50 shades of Grey, etc)__

Anything Aaron Sorkin.

__Who is your celebrity crush?__

Meryl Streep, could there be a classier or more talented actress?

__How do you define success?__

Achieving happiness.

__If you had one year that you could say was the best year of your life what year would it be? Why? How old were you?__

In 2008, I quit my job, traded in my stilettos for hiking boots, and backpacked around the globe.  I traveled to approximately 25 third world countries over 16 months. I could go on and on about what I saw and learned, but I will just say this: I came away being more inspired, more aware, and most importantly, a believer that if you think you can’t, you probably can – you just need to put your head down and do it.

__Describe a time you failed. What did you learn from that experience?__

I fail every time I try to be someone I’m not.

__What do you do fun?__

I love to travel, so I plan as many trips as my schedule allows.

__Do you have a hidden talent?__

Unfortunately all my hidden talents are still undiscovered.

__What is your favorite mobile app?__

Ha, my former Admeld colleagues would laugh at this question…. I just moved from blackberry to Android at the beginning of the year.

__What do you do to help focus?__

A cup of coffee and Jack Johnson.

__Cool Kid or Nerd in High school?__

Both.

__Any words of advice for up & coming attorney’s who are trying to get noticed?__

NETWORK, NETWORK, NETWORK.  Its important to get your name out there, you never know who you will meet, and who that person will know.  Everyone is just a few degrees away from meeting someone who can help move him or her into the next phase of their career.  It’s also important to stay interesting- there are many talented attorneys out there, but people are always drawn to interesting and well-rounded individuals.

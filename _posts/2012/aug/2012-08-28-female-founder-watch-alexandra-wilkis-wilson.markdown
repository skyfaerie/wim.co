__Alexandra Wilkis Wilson__, 
_Co-Founder of Gilt Groupe_

__Who inspires you?__

People who overcome adversity.

__Why have you decided to become an entrepreneur?__

I believed in the opportunity and the team. The timing was right for me in my career and my personal life. It was time for me to take a risk and pursue this vision.

__Where do you see your company in the next five years?__

I think Gilt will be a global leader in luxury ecommerce
 
__How is your company different from its competition?__

From a tech perspective, we make it fun, easy and exciting to shop. From a merchandising perspective, we go to painstaking detail curate everything that we feature on our site to bring our members the best of the best.

__What was a defining moment in your career?__

November 13th, 2007. The day of our very first sale on Gilt Groupe. It was a Zac Posen sale.

__What is your next step within your career?__

I am still very attached to Gilt Groupe. She is honestly like my child and she is growing up very quickly. I think she is in her adolescent years right about now. I must stick with her until she is at least in college!

__How did you finance your business when it was at the early stage? (Self-funded, crowd-funded, Angel Investor, VC)__

For our Series A we went the VC route, with Matrix. They have been a fantastic partner. 

__Tell me something about yourself that we don’t know already.__

I have a phobia of pigeons! I really don’t like them!

__What is your favorite color?__

My closet is like a rainbow… I love color but I also do wear a lot of black, I am a New Yorker after all. 

__What is your guilty pleasure? (Real Housewives, Chocolate, 50 shades of Grey, etc)__

Shopping on Gilt Groupe. I am serious.

__Who is your celebrity crush?__

I guess I would have to say George…

__How do you define success?__

Being happy with the choices you make in life.

__If you had one year that you could say was the best year of your life what year would it be? Why? How old were you?__

 2007 . I got married to the man of my dreams and it was the year we launched Gilt.

__Describe a time you failed. What did you learn from that experience?__

I failed my first driving exam! That was depressing! 

__What do you do for fun?__

I spend time with my family.

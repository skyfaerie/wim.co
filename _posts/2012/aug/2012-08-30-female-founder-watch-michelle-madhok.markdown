__Michelle Madhok__

_CEO and Founder_

_Publisher of shefinds.com and momfinds.com_

_SHEFINDS MEDIA_
 
__Who inspires you?__

Martha Stewart

__Why have you decided to become an entrepreneur?__

I don’t deal well with authority.
 
__Where do you see your company in the next five years?__

Much bigger and better and needing less of me in the day to day.
 
__How is your “Finds” series of websites (shefinds.com and momfinds.com) different from other fashion blogs?__

We focus on the actionable. What can you do/buy? Not just pretty photographs.
 
__What was a defining moment in your career?__

When I arrived at CBS in 1995 and they asked if I “did internet.” I said I had an AOL account and they put me in charge of cbs.com.
 
__What is your next step within your career?__

It’s not a career. It’s a life. All I can do is keep trying to do better every day.
 
__How did you finance your business when it was at the early stage? (Self-funded, crowd-funded, Angel Investor, VC)__

Bootstrapped for 3 years then raised $1.3M then bought the equity back last year.

__Tell me something about yourself that we don’t know already.__

I’ve spent $3K on laser hair removal over the last 10 years and it was totally worth it.
 
__What is your favorite color?__

It changes. Right now I’m into Pantone’s color of the year, [Tangerine Tango][tangerine].
 
__What is your guilty pleasure? (Real Housewives, Chocolate, 50 shades of Grey, etc)__

The song Call Me Maybe.
 
__Who is your celebrity crush?__

[Suri Cruise][suri]
 
__How do you define success?__

Getting to own my time.
 
__If you had one year that you could say was the best year of your life what year would it be? Why? How old were you?__

Each year keeps getting better. So this past year – age 40 – is one of the best. Also this is the year my book, [Wear This Now][wear], comes out.
 
__Describe a time you failed. What did you learn from that experience?__

I did amazing work at AOL, but I consistently had problems with bosses – 12 of them over 5 years.  I learned a distaste for corporate culture and strive to do it differently at SHEFINDS MEDIA.
 
__What do you do fun?__

Post Instagram photos of my super cute dog, Gumby, at our house on the North Fork of Island while drinking copious amounts of Crouteaux Rose.

__Do you have a hidden talent?__

I used to be a really talented fiction writer. I was accepted to the University of Iowa MFA program, but I couldn’t bring myself to move to Iowa.
 
__What is your favorite mobile app?__

Stitcher. I’m a podcast addict. Multitasking! Love Slate XX podcast and NPR Pop Culture Happy Hour.
 
__What do you do to help focus?__

Clear my inbox and try to get back into the GTD system.
 
__Cool Kid or Nerd in High school?__

AP class, yearbook/newspaper editor nerd that had a few cool kid friends, but wrote scandalous articles about the Student Body President.
 
__What is your favorite style trend for the fall?__

Smoking slippers. Who doesn’t want to wear slippers in public?

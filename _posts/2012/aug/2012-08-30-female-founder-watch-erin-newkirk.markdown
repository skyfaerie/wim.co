__Erin Newkirk__

_Co-Founder & CEO_

_Red Stamp_
 
__Who inspires you?__

Pretty much everyone I follow on social media. It’s a long list because it’s rare I meet someone who doesn’t inspire me in some way…for business, for creativity, for bravery, for giving. Inspiration is all around us.
 
__Why have you decided to become an entrepreneur?__

Because I saw ways I could solve personal need{s} that would also benefit others. 
 
__Where do you see your company in the next five years?__

Making Relationships Stronger…in whatever way our clients need us the most.
 
__How is Red Stamp different from other personalized photo app companies?__

Red Stamp strives to be the modern day social secretary. So, it’s not *just* about personalizing photos — though we love doing that! — it’s about helping our users elevate each and every correspondence to make their relationships stronger.
 
__What was a defining moment in your career?__

When I realized I didn’t have to choose between doing what I love and taking care of those I love. {Note…I’m incredibly fortunate my sweet spots align.}
 
__What is your next step within your career?__

Founding + building businesses and brands that help others is pretty much my nirvana. My plan is to stick with that and see where it takes me. Mentoring, speaking, start-upping…it’s all within bounds.

__How did you finance your business when it was at the early stage? (Self-funded, crowd-funded, Angel Investor, VC)__

Self-funded and friends + family

__Tell me something about yourself that we don’t know already.__

I just turned 40 last week and am really excited about the next decade. Love turning life’s pages…   (Happy Belated Erin!)
 
__What is your favorite color?__

What day is it today? {Laughs} 
 
__What is your guilty pleasure? (Real Housewives, Chocolate, 50 shades of Grey, etc)__

I’ve never met a Vampire movie or TV show I wasn’t immediately sucked into. Pun intended.
 
__Who is your celebrity crush?__

Colin Firth. Handsome, talented, seemingly nice. Total package.
 
__How do you define success?__

Happiness. 
 
__Describe a time you failed. What did you learn from that experience?__

I learned that there really is no such thing as “failing.” That every set-back happens for a reason. It’s like the universe is waving a big flag in your face saying “don’t do that….do this instead!” Not that set-backs can’t be painful in the moment, but they almost always result in a MUCH better outcome. 
 
__What do you do fun?__

I have the BEST group of friends and family…we tend to do a lot of socializing. Dinners, parties, trips.

__Do you have a hidden talent?__

Does touching my tongue to the tip of my nose count?
 
__What is your favorite mobile app, besides your own?__

Instagram. Love how much closer it brings me to those I don’t see everyday.
 
__What do you do to help focus?__

Listen to music. Our CTO, Dan Wick, is a music guru…so I pretty much listen to anything he listens to. Thanks, Dan + Spotify!
 
__Cool Kid or Nerd in High school?__

Isn’t everyone kind of nerdy in high school?
 
__Any words of advice for up & coming entrepreneurs who are trying to get noticed?__

Yes! Actually, I shot a little video for WIM on this very topic! Being an entrepreneur is challenging, but incredibly rewarding. You experience the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. It’s not the same sort of straight line to success, but if you pick something you are passionate about, the whole is definitely more than the sum of its parts. You can change the world. How cool is that?

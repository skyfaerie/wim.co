__Kelly Stickel__

_Founder and President_

_Remodista_


__Who inspires you?__

Oprah Winfrey, Donna Karen, Hilary Clinton, Michelle Obama. Gloria Steinem, Sarah Blakely, Sheryl Sandberg, Marissa Mayer

__Why have you decided to become an entrepreneur?__

I became an entrepreneur because I found a passion to build thought leadership focused on luxury retail and mobility.   The path had an internal pull that I could not ignore.  However, I also have a full time job at the Digital Marketing Agency, Acquity Group, if that paints a different picture.

__Where do you see your company in the next five years?__

I see Remodista as being a thought leader in Global Retail Mobility.  

__How is Remodista different from its competitor companies?__

The differentiator is that we build our collaborative events with women in mind.  While the event is open to both men and women, we understand the modern woman is looking for a better experience.

__What was a defining moment in your career?__

Having the opportunity to have a series of meetings with my CEO, and discuss my passion for global retail mobility and commerce.  He is a champion of entrepreneurial thinking, so our meetings are thought provoking and invaluable to my career.

__What is your next step within your career?__

Next step are to move into a more strategic and innovative role, continue thought leadership focused on global retail mobility, and continue to mentor young ladies looking to get to the next level.

__How did you finance your business when it was at the early stage? (Self-funded, crowd-funded, Angel Investor, VC)__

I financed the business with my own money and then a small business loan from the bank.

__Tell me something about yourself that we don’t know already.__

I also work as a mosaic artist and teach classes when I can fit them into my schedule.

__What is your favorite color?__

It changes – now it is hunter green – it’s almost fall

__What is your guilty pleasure? (Real Housewives, Chocolate, 50 shades of Grey, etc)__

Shark Tank, Mexican food, being barefoot

__Who is your celebrity crush?__

Clive Owen 

__How do you define success?__

Contentment

__If you had one year that you could say was the best year of your life what year would it be? Why? How old were you?__

Hmmm…not sure I had it yet…I started writing the book: You Don’t Have to Peak in High School…or at 30. Then I scratched 30 out and put 40 ☺ I am going to say that my favorite has not yet happened

__Describe a time you failed. What did you learn from that experience?__

I have failed a lot…let me see.  I tried out for cheer leading in the 9th grade.  I made up my cheer and my best friends cheer.  She made the team and I didn’t.  Lesson: Don’t make up other people’s cheers.  I made it the next year

__What do you do for fun?__

I create art, play around with photography, go to flea markets and find cool old stuff, try new restaurants, talk about retail and mobility☺.

__Do you have a hidden talent?__

I am very persuasive.  

__What is your favorite mobile app?__

I like my Chase App, Tripit, Gilt Groupe, Facebook

__What do you do to help focus?__

Focus – I don’t need help in this area.  I just do it. It is in the first quadrant (Steve Covey’s First Things First)

__Cool Kid or Nerd in High school?__

Cool kid with a vein of nerd

__What is your favorite beauty trend this fall?__

Fitted sheath dresses – jersey knit, the golden yellow color, gold and leather

__Any words of advice for up-and-coming entrepreneurs who are trying to get noticed?__

Don’t focus on getting noticed.  Focus on building something well and putting it in front of the right audience. However, I don’t know that I have been fully noticed, so I might not be the best advice giver on this question!

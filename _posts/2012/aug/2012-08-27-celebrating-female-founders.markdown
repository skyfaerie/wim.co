Join Women Innovate Mobile (WIM) on Fashion’s Night Out (Thursday, September 6) when we celebrate the launch of [Plum Alley][plum-alley] and extraordinary female founders.


Founded by Deborah Jackson, [Plum Alley][plum-alley] is the leading discovery site where you can promote female founders by purchasing their exquisite products. Each week, Plum Alley will feature the story of a female entrepreneur alongside a showcase of personally hand-selected items.


Listed in [Forbes][forbes] as one of five women changing the world in VC/entrepreneurship, Deborah Jackson is also a co-founder of [WIM][wim], the founder of [JumpThru][jump-thru] and a [Golden Seeds][golden-seeds] angel investor.

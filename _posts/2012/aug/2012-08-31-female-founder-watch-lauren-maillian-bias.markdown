__Lauren Maillian Bias__

_Founder and CEO_

_Luxury Market Branding_
 
__Who inspires you?__

Ariana Huffington
 
__Why have you decided to become an entrepreneur?__

Because I believe in creating your own vision for a future that works best for you. Sometimes that means innovating, trailblazing, supporting or bringing a new approach to an overlooked area.
 
__Where do you see your company in the next five years?__

I see Luxury Market Branding having a presence in cities with phenomenal talent and style.
 
__How is your company different from other marketing and branding companies?__

We bring a fresh yet entrepreneurial approach to strategic marketing and branding. We help brands carve out future partnerships and actually negotiate them on our clients behalf, then we help market them.

__What was a defining moment in your career?__

Selling my first business to start Luxury Market Branding. It was like taking the entrepreneurial plunge all over again with no time to catch my breath (literally)
 
__What is your next step within your career?__

A book is somewhere in my professional future.
 
__How did you finance your business when it was at the early stage? (Self-funded, crowd-funded, Angel Investor, VC)__

To-date, I have self-funded all of my businesses, though that may change one day!
 
__Tell me something about yourself that we don’t know already.__

I was an equestrian and competed extensively for 15 years.
 
__What is your favorite color?__

Purple, though I love to wear black- I’m a New Yorker!
 
__What is your guilty pleasure? (Real Housewives, Chocolate, 50 shades of Grey, etc)__

Reflexology.
 
__Who is your celebrity crush?__

Hmmm… Does their intellect count?!
 
__How do you define success?__

I am still figuring that one out myself, but for right now, I’d define success by being able to comfortably do what you love.
 
__If you had one year that you could say was the best year of your life what year would it be? Why? How old were you?__

2012 has been the most amazing year of my life. At 27, 2012 has shown me freedom, love, joy, success, and how strong I truly am.
 
__Describe a time you failed. What did you learn from that experience?__

I failed miserably in 2009, but I learned that sometimes we discredit our ability to persevere without a partner- what we may view as misfortunes in a moment, may actually turn out to be the greatest gift you’ll ever receive.
 
__What do you for fun?__

Travel and hang out with my little ones.
 
__Do you have a hidden talent?__

The ability to pick the best wines on a phenomenal wine list!
 
__What is your favorite mobile app?__

Mapquest- why pay for a navigation system when you travel?!
 
__What do you do to help focus?__

I try to keep a healthy workout regimen that involves lots of yoga.
 
__Cool Kid or Nerd in High school?__

I was probably considered the nerd in school- sshhh!

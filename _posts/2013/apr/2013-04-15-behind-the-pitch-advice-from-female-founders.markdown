All money is not the same. There is good money and there is bad money. Be choosy! Because bad money will kill you as quick if not quicker than no money at all... – Erin Newkirk, RedStamp


Get a ton of publicity and look outside NYC. – Michelle Madhok, She Finds Media


A pitch to a VC/Angel is not the same message as a pitch to a potential customer. All they want to know is: is there a problem (have you done your research)? How are you going to fix it (have you done your research on the approach)? And that you are the right one to do this. Oh...and most of all, how will you make money from it! – Tara Hunt, Buyosphere


Do everything you possibly can to avoid needing to raise funding.  Bootstrap. Starve. Beg, borrow, steal. Get your product out there in the marketplace under its own steam, gaining traction. a) That makes it easier to raise funding, and b) if you've designed it around the right kind of business model - the kind that makes money from day one - you won't have to.  – Cindy Gallop, Make Love Not Porn


Keep control of your company. – Michelle Madhok, She Finds Media

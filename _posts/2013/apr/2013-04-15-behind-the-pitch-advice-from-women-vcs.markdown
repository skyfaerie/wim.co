Don't "pitch".  Tell a story.   – Mary Lemmer

 
For a quick pitch, make it simple and clear. Tell me succinctly and directly what it is you're doing and what problem that solves. Try out your simple elevator pitch on friends in the startup scene and outside of it and see if they have understand what you're talking about. It's ok to use analogies if they hold ("this for that") -- anything that allows someone to quickly understand what you're doing can help. You must then be prepared to own that positioning ("…right, so like an airbnb for cats, but we're focused on…"). – Ellie Wheeler, Greycroft

 
Be confident and be yourself.   – Mary Lemmer

 
My words of wisdom for females seeking funding is to assume they will be pitching their ideas to men who might be unfamiliar with their concepts if their companies are targeted towards women.  For example, a male investor might not understand how many women will spends 1000s of dollars a year on blow-dries... Female co-founders, founders etc have to explain their use case potentially using comparisons the opposite sex can relate too!  - Caroline Scheinfeld, Zelkova

 
Be resilient.  Be ready to hear "no" but don't let that bring you down. – Mary Lemmer

 
Women need to have more swagger during fundraising time. Male founders typically say 'hurry up, there's only $250K left of my $500K round!' Women will say 'crap, I've only raised $250K towards my goal.'  To use an over-the-top anecdote for a moment…if a pair of jeans doesn't fit, remember that it's because your waist is too small…not that your rear is too large. Women need to focus on the success demonstrated by their in-progress achievements. So be proud of the fact that you raised TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND FREAKING DOLLARS, and realize that investors are lucky to get in since you're limiting the amount you will raise. – Christine Herron, Intel Capital

 
Be confident – you have been invited to pitch and your audience wants to hear you present.  Also listen – if they are asking questions, be flexible to respond.  Let them see your vision and get interested in it first…time for details when you have subsequent meetings. – Kathleen Utecht, Comcast Ventures

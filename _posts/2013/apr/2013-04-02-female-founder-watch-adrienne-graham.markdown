**Who inspires you?**

It's hard to pick just one. I'm inspired by people who are unafraid and unapologetic about being ambitious, but also feel an obligation to give back. If I had to pick one person it would be Magic Johnson. He has built tremendous success while still remaining humble and continues to give back. He made it possible to invest successfully in the inner city.
 

**Why are you an entrepreneur?**

I'm an entrepreneur because I wanted to create my own destiny and provide a legacy for my son. Plus, I don't like taking orders. I believe that everyone should try entrepreneurship at least once in their time to see if it's right for them. I also believe that entrepreneurship isn't just about being a business owner and making a lot of money. While that certainly helps, it's really about creating opportunities and jobs for others, affecting change in the economy, creating economic freedom and innovating to solve a problem or need. Entrepreneurship has afforded me the opportunities to build my family's wealth, employ others, share my example of what can happen when you work hard and put your mind to it, and solve the needs of my customers.

 
**What was a defining moment in your career?**

A defining moment for me was in the very beginning of running a business, a potential client managed to talk me down to a 10% recruiting fee (industry averages were between 20-33%). When he got me down to 10% he asked if I had "learned my lesson yet". He taught me that if I didn't place a value on myself then someone else would and it would be way lower than what I was really worth. That lesson stuck with me and set the tone for how I valued my services and my businesses.

 
**How is your company different from your competitors?**

That's a tough one. I would say that while most of my competitors are relying on automated or on-demand solutions to serve the masses, my company focuses on bringing targeted clients the total experience. I don't follow the trends of the crowds. I listen to what my clients and audience wants, then deliver to them with personalized, customized service. Customers will remember how you made them feel and how you really listen to them to fulfill their needs.


**Where do you see your company in the next five years?**

I see [Empower Me! Corporation](http://www.empowerme.org/) being the top international resource providing consulting, content and education for helping companies grow in any economy. We will produce content for cable specifically for small businesses and filling that void that networks such as Bloomberg, CNBC and Fox Business miss or ignore. I also see the company, the brand, being responsible for bringing other entrepreneurs to the forefront by providing a voice and platform to share their message.

 
**What's next for your company?**

We have several projects in the works for 2013. In April, the launch of the print version of Empower Me! Magazine and relaunch of Empower Me! Institute. In May, the launch of our Business Owners' Club and Power Broker Accountability Club, in June, we kick of the Pick My Brain Tour, and in September our first growth strategies retreat.


**How did you finance your business when it was at the early stage? (Self-funded, crowd-funded, Angel Investor, VC)**

I bootstrapped my businesses. Empower Me! Corporation was funded by money saved from running my recruiting firm. I haven't yet sought funding for the company, but as we grow, I may consider it.


**Tell me something about yourself that we don’t know already.**

I am very spiritual. I don't do anything, make any decisions without praying on it first. And I was once a Girl Scout.


**What is your guilty pleasure?**

Shoes. I am a shoe addict. I just love them. In fact, I have a business plan outlined for a shoe business. It's the plan I used as part of a final project in an entrepreneurship class I took in college. I received an A on the project and my professor said I should make it a business. One day I will.


**Describe a time you failed. What did you learn from that experience?**

I've failed a lot. As an entrepreneur, you have to be prepared for and embrace failure. It keeps you humble and learning. One instance where I failed was when I didn't launch my magazine as planned. I listened to people who steered me wrong and gave me false information. When it didn't launch on schedule I was devastated. It took a long time for me to gain back my confidence. From the experience, I learned that I can never let other people's hangups and opinions get stuck in my head. I learned that if I let too many people have input into my plans, I'll never go through with my vision. Other people's hangups are not my problem.

 
**What is your favorite mobile app?**

Square hands down. I love being able to accept payments on the go.

 
**What do you do to help focus?**

I shut off from the world and sit out on my deck with my iPod and various audio programs from successful entrepreneurs. Hearing their success stories and advice motivates me to move beyond my comfort zone.

 
**What’s your cause?**

To help entrepreneurs and small business owners understand that no matter who's in office, no matter what the economy looks like, they have the power to grow their business.

 
**Any words of advice for entrepreneurs who are trying to get their ventures launched?**

I would tell any entrepreneur to never give up on their dream, but don't be afraid to shift when necessary. Nobody's plans ever go 100% as planned. Without having experienced the ups and downs of entrepreneurship, it's easy for new entrepreneurs to throw in the towel when they encounter a roadblock. Being open to change and willing to try new approaches has been a life saver for me. Now when something doesn't work out, instead of panicking, I'm thinking of ways around the obstacle. Entrepreneurship is a great test in resolve, problem solving and ingenuity. It is the best professional development exercise you will ever experience.

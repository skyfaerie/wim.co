**What’s the worst mistake a founder can make?**

Not be willing to change things in mid-stream. The phrase 'Don't Change Horses in Mid Stream' is attributed to a speech made by Lincoln in 1864. Probably doesn't apply today!


**What’s the most common Startup error?**

Getting rich on a calculator.


**What does “fail fast” mean to you?**

We've seen it a thousand times. People are petrified to put things out into the market until they think its perfect. Get it out there, warts and all.

 
**If you could fix one thing in the startup eco-system right now, what would it be?**

Have a story that OTHERS would want to share. Not just a commercial for your startup.


**What should startups be focusing on right now?**

Spreading their story. Have it ready for all screens too. Mobile of course.


**When’s the right time to seek funding?**

Never a great time if you can avoid it. Saps the energy out of the founders and redirects them from what got them interested in doing their business in the first place. I always say…last resort option in early stages.

 
**Thoughts on crowd-funding?**

Obviously, its the hot thing right now. If you have the right product for that vehicle, I say try it. (See Fail Fast above)


**Best advice you’ve ever gotten?**

Someone said these exact words over 15 years ago to me. "Things have worked out in your life so far, correct? I guarantee they will in the future"


**Guess who’s coming for dinner…who would be your dream dinner guest(s) and why?**

Robin Williams. Martin Short. Jon Stewart.   Life is short. Laugh a lot.

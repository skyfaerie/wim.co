WIM co-founder Kelly Hoey spoke at the [NPower](http://www.npower.org/) Women’s Council Leadership Breakfast at JPMorgan Chase on April 3. The panel was moderated by Avis Yates-Rivers a member of the board of directors of [NCWIT](http://www.ncwit.org/) (National Center for Women & Information Technology).

From NCWIT, some shocking numbers:

* 1.4 million computer specialist openings expected in the U.S. by 2020
* 30% of these jobs could be filled by U.S. computing graduates by 2020
* 25% of professional computing occupations in the 2011 U.S. workforce are held by women
* 3% of computing workforce who were African-American women in 2011
* 4% of computing workforce who were Asian women in 2011
* 1% of computing workforce who were Hispanic women in 2011
* 79% decline in the number of first-year undergraduate women interested in majoring in Computer Science between 2000 and 2011.
 

Add it up  - the computing crisis is happening now and the opportunity lost gets greater with each passing year. Let’s change these numbers before 2020.

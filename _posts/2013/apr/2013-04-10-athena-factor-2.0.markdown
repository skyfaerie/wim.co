In 2008, the Center developed research that targeted women in science, engineering and technology (SET) fields. The project—named the Athena Factor to honor the Greek goddess of wisdom—set out to examine the career trajectories of women with SET credentials who worked in the private sector.

The research is targeting women IT (SET) professionals at all levels.  The first leg of this groundbreaking research was published as an article and special report by the Harvard Business Review. It had huge impact, triggering a debate about how best to stem the “regrettable losses.” The research pointed to a “flight or fight” moment in women’s careers when attrition rates spiked. This was of particular interest to business leaders because it showed when and where supportive policies and practices were likely to have the most traction. Five years later, it’s time to revisit this valuable research and analyze the progress that has (or hasn’t) been made since the first study.  Athena Factor 2.0 will “go global” and examine the highly qualified female talent pool not only in the U.S. but also in Brazil, India, and China.

Your participation in this phase of data collection would be invaluable, as it is your first-hand experience that will deepen the awareness around women in SET fields.

The Center is conducting its trademark Insights In-Depth® sessions for Athena Factor 2.0. Insights In-Depth® is a “virtual” focus group, one that facilitates group discussion and brainstorming through simultaneous online and voice communication.  If you elect to participate, you can do so from any location that has both internet and phone access.  Most of your input will be via your keyboard; you are not expected to speak on the call.  The session is conducted in English and lasts approximately 60 minutes.  Anything you say will remain completely anonymous, as you will be provided a random user name upon entering the session.

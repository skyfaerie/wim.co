**What’s the worst mistake a founder can make?**

Not doing his/her homework ... on their sector, their competition, their products (yes, I have met some founders who can't explain the purpose of their product or service).

 
**What’s the most common Startup error?**

Unsustainable and unrealistic burn rates.  Spending too much too fast. 

 
**What does “fail fast” mean to you?**

Sounds like a disease I don't want to catch!

 
**If you could fix one thing in the startup eco-system right now, what would it be?**

To see it flooded with women, women and more Women entrepreneurs and investors.

 
**What should startups be focusing on right now?**

When’s the right time to seek funding?  This is a tough one.  Depends on so many variables.  Hmmm

 
**Thoughts on crowd-funding?**

A fantastic tool to put into an entrepreneurs tool box.   Having said that, to only use strategically both for raising money and marketing/branding purposes. It can backfire and has.

 
**Best advice you’ve ever gotten?**

Trust Your Gut Every Time.


**Guess who’s coming for dinner…who would be your dream dinner guest(s) and why?**

Right now there isn't much I would do for a conversation with Google's Susan Wojcicki.  Why?  She's responsible for 96% of the revenues at the most powerful company on earth.  Her products are fundamentally changing the way the advertising and content businesses operate.

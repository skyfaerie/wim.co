Our "Meet The Innovators" speaker series is going global!

Meet the Innovators started in January of this year in the [Apple Retail Store in SoHo](http://www.apple.com/retail/soho/) (NYC) with a conversation on Social TV. Since then, we discussed Venture Capital, eCommerce, startup communities, viral marketing videos + more and gained incredible insights from the expertise (and humor) of our accomplished panelists. Now we're partnering with Apple to take Meet The Innovators to Apple Retail Stores in Chicago and London (Fall 2013) with Berlin and other U.S. and international cities in our expansion plans for the near future. It's our opportunity to contribute content to the global startup conversation and to engage IRL (and via podcast) with entrepreneurs, investors and startup founders, globally.



Join us and be part of the conversation.

Meet The Innovators is back at the Apple Retail Store in SoHo on August 14 for a conversation with [Tech Changemakers](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/meet-the-innovators-tech-changemakers-tickets-6281320599): Adda Birnir, co-founder of SkillCrush; Kimberly Bryant, founder of Black Girls Code; Jocelyn Leavitt and Samantha John, co-founders of Hopscotch; Kristen Titus, Executive Director, Girls Who Code; and Rachel Weiss, VP, Digital Innovation, Content, and New Business Ventures, L’Oreal, who are sparking STEM curiosity and working to educate, inspire and equip the next generation of technologists and programmers.

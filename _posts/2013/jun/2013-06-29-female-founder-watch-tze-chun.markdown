**Who inspires you?**

The incredible artists we work with. Their artwork challenges me to view the world in a new way, and motivates me to continue connecting them with people who will enjoy their work for the rest of their lives.

We also have an incredible board of advisors including: Angela Sun (Chief‐of‐Staff to the President of Bloomberg, L.P.), Holly Lynch (Founder and CEO, The 85-Percent), Phil Guinand (Permira Advisers LLC), and Jon Feinstein (Co-founder of Humble Arts Foundation).

**Why are you an entrepreneur?**

When I was in fourth grade, we started a segment on problem solving in math class and I fell in love with it. I looked forward to the class all morning and to doing my homework each night.

Not much has changed! Being an entrepreneur means constantly problem solving and I love the challenges and rewards of running the gallery.

**What was a defining moment in your career?** 

Winning the DailyCandy Start Small Go Big Contest in 2012. I've been a DailyCandy subscriber since they launched and it was such an honor to have them believe in our company. They arranged for us to meet with mentors such as Chris Burch and Jonathan Adler, and companies such as Birchbox, DwellStudio and countless others. It was the beginning of our current momentum.

**How is your company different from your competitors?**

When I founded Uprise, there were a number of online marketplaces for artists and websites selling affordable art prints. I wanted to give one-of-a-kind original works the same exposure while also maintaining a high level of curation. We are very much a traditional gallery in that we maintain close, personal ties to our artists and collectors, but we differ from brick-and-mortar galleries because of our accessibility online and the option for collectors to "invest-over-time".

**Where do you see your company in the next five years?**

We've noticed that a lot of our clients are actually looking for art to hang in their offices since (unfortunately) they spend more time there than at home. We're starting to work with companies, ranging from small startups to large corporations, to build art collections that emphasize their company mission statements. In the next five years, I see this playing a larger and larger role in what we offer as a gallery.

We've also started partnering with really great companies and venues such as Chelsea Market, DwellStudio, Haus Interior, Bonobos and HomePolish. It's so fun to work creatively with other teams and we're excited to keep partnering with exciting companies that we love.

**What's next for your company?**

Our first move into mobile technology! We just launched the Uprise Art iPad App. We partnered with NConnex, a team of west coast developers, on the Uprise Art iPad app, which allows users to see our artwork to scale in real time in their homes and offices using augmented reality technology. I’m really excited that our clients can see how artwork will look in their space and be sure that it will fit.

We also have a number of exhibitions and collaborations this Summer including: a show in the Lower East Side, a project with Bonobos, and a art party at the BaubleBar Pop-up Shop in SoHo.  Readers can find out about our events and exhibitions at blog.upriseart.com.

**How did you finance your business when it was at the early stage? (Self-funded, crowd-funded, Angel Investor, VC)**

We launched our website September of 2011 and were boot strapped for the first 18 months. We just raised a seed round from angel investors.

**Tell me something about yourself that we don’t know already.**

I love the Summer movie series at Bryant Park! I'm there almost every Monday in the summer with a "mega-blanket" I made seven years ago specifically for the occasion. It's so fun to have a little oasis in the middle of the city and to have a tradition that brings together friends, food, and film.

**What is your guilty pleasure?**

Dance movies. I actually bought the Step Up 2 soundtrack when it came out.

**Describe a time you failed. What did you learn from that experience?**

In 2011, I applied to DailyCandy’s Start Small Go Big contest and didn’t make the finalist list.

When applications came out for the 2012 contest, I wasn’t sure we had a chance. My intern, who went on to be the company's first employee, convinced me to reapply and we went on win in the ‘Home’ category. My fear of getting rejected twice almost kept us from one of our biggest break-through moments. I learned to keep trying, and to not fear failure when you truly think you have a good idea.
 
**What is your favorite mobile app?**

Foursquare. It's such an amazing resource for fun ways to explore the city and meet up with my close friends. It's so fun to check out (or "check in") a new restaurant and see tips my friends have left and recommendations of what to try.

**What’s your cause?**
 
To draw out the art lover in everyone and making it easy for collectors to make personal connections with artists and find art they can afford.

**Any words of advice for entrepreneurs who are trying to get their ventures launched?**

Ask for advice and don’t be afraid of being bothersome. It’s likely that many people will be as excited about your venture as you are. In year one, I constantly asked for introductions and met with countless entrepreneurs and art dealers.

Listen to your clients and the people you depend on. I asked many artists about their needs in and concerns with the art world, and what sort of artist-gallery relationship they wanted. Similarly, I viewed everyone as a potential collector, and listened to their comments and suggestions. Not everything will work from the get-go, and it’s important to look for solutions anywhere you can. 

**Elevator pitch:**

Uprise Art is an online art gallery for the next generation of collectors. Whether you’re a seasoned art collector or in the dark when it comes to art, Uprise Art’s expertly curated collection makes collecting easy and enjoyable.

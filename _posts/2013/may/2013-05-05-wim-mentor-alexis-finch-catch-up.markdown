**Describe what you're focusing on now.**

Moving to NYC. BWAHAHAHH! I'm looking forward to hot summer nights on rooftops and in city parks…oh, and building my first web-app from soup to nuts.


**What's your greatest challenge?**

Remembering that if I spend all my time helping other people, I'll never have time to make anything myself. It's a fine balance, between keeping up connections and being an active part of the community, and actually finding time to create.


**Game of Thrones or Top Chef?**

99% Invisible, DecodeDC, Radiolab, This American Life, Snap Judgement and The Moth.


**What's the biggest myth about starting a company?**

It's not about the idea. The idea comes after you've found people you trust, people who inspire you, people who believe in you and who you believe in right back. That's what the really great ideas are born from. Facebook was a stupid "hot or not" site at the beginning. Twilio was built to book bike couriers to deliver resold concert tickets. The real ideas can only happen when you're not scared to share them, watch them be broken to bits and then rebuild the pieces into something actually awesome. It's like LEGOS. You don't go and lock away the first yellow and blue castle you build, do you?


**Back to the future. If you could go back in time, what tech would you invent?**

As in, what cool thing do I think is the raddest claim to fame? Pneumatic tube delivery systems are pretty rad.

**One questions entrepreneurs should be asking right now.**

Will my grandmother be proud of me for building this? Seriously. Just because you can get people to use something, just because you can make millions off it, doesn't mean you should. We've got the equivalent of entrepreneurs making napalm and then patting themselves on the back for all the profits they've generated. Not cool y'all.

**What’s your favorite iPad App?**

I don't have an iPad. But ":Shift" blends design and intrinsic game interaction in a way every app creator should take a serious look at.

Oh. And I did this:

I really want to get to do more murals in other spaces designed to inspire. If all goes right, I'll be turning some of the snippets into T-Shirts as well!

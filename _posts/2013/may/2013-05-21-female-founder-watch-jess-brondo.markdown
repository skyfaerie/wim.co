**Elevator pitch:**

Admitted.ly is automating and gamifying the role of a high school guidance counselor online through Klout-like Admittability Scores and psychometric tests that match students to ideal schools based on their personality metrics. It is also the only college discovery site that gives students customized recommendations on how to improve their chances of admission based on their interests, location, goals, and budget.

**Describe what you're focusing on now.** 

We've been releasing a lot of features lately at RebelMouse so I've been focusing a lot on helping these features get ready, thinking about how we should launch them and supporting that whole process. We're never done just because something's "out" -- then we have to listen to feedback and iterate to make it better. 

 
**What's your greatest challenge?**

Prioritizing and focus. It's easy to let the "fires" take up all your time, but it's so essential to have time to really think about what's going to move the needle. 

 
**Game of Thrones or Top Chef?**
 
I can't watch Top Chef because I become way too hungry. I recently started watching Game of Thrones but am only like 6 episodes in so don't tell me anything!
 

**What's the biggest myth about starting a company?** 

Hmmm, depends if you're talking inside or outside the "tech world". I think from the outside there's either a sense that it's incredibly glamorous and fun and you just drinks beer in the office or the opposite that it's something for nerds and people can't articulate themselves. Lately I think much more the former. 

**Back to the future. If you could go back in time, what tech would you invent?**

You mean if I could be the inventor of any one technology? It'd be pretty amazing to have invented the microchip, since it's the basis of so much of our technology today. But also, the microwave. 

 
**One question entrepreneurs should be asking right now.** 

In general I think just more questions from people they respect. I think startups can get caught in a bubble and also in the early stages get scared someone is going to "steal" their idea. But ultimately you just need to get advice and learn and make your product the best, that's how you'll win. 

 
**What's your favorite iPad App?** 

Honestly ever since I got a Kindle, I've been using my iPad a lot less. Probably the main thing I use on it now is Hulu and Netflix, both of which work impressively well.

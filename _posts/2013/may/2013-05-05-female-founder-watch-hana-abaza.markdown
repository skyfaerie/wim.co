**Who inspires you?**

People who have strength but in a nuanced way. It comes from their excitement, passion and kindness.

**Why are you an entrepreneur?**

I love problem solving - finding solutions (sometimes they’re simple and sometimes they’re messy and hacky) to help myself and the people around me. I’ve always been a big believer in not accepting the status quo, so if something sucks - fix it!

**How is your company different from your competitors?**

We understand the importance of the experience and the social dynamic in our space better than anyone - while a strong tech backbone is instrumental, at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter what you build. It’s how people use it that matters.

**Where do you see your company in the next five years?**

Hitting the mainstream on a couple of fronts - both on the B2B side and the B2C presence. In our industry there is a high level of fragmentation and moving forward will require the ability to navigate this and be able to see when key areas are ripe for aggregation.

**What's the next milestone for your company?**

We have a couple of partnerships in the works. More on this later!

**How are you financing your business? What are your growth plans?**

We bootstrapped up to a point and then raised an Angel round to scale the consumer side of the business. Now we’ve shifted our focus towards the B2B side - the next 6 to 8 months will be telling in terms of how we’ll move forward with our growth plan.

**Best advice you've received.**

Three things:

1. Don’t become a solution looking for a problem. If you lose sight of the problem it doesn’t matter how awesome your product might be.

2. Forget perfection. Launching a product that is 90% complete will tell you how the last 10% should look.

3. Failure is okay. It sucks, but it’s okay. In fact it can be a great thing, acting as a compass for your next steps.

**Tell me something about yourself that we don’t know already.**

I have a black belt in Jiu-Jitsu. Before delving into the startup/tech world years ago, I ran a chain of Martial Arts studios - I also taught professionally for 15 years.

**What is your guilty pleasure?**

Watching old reruns of News Radio - don’t judge!

**A setback, stumble or face plant...What did you learn from that experience?**

There have been many stumbles, setbacks and definitely a few face plants, but one that stands out early in my career is underestimating the value that a technical co-founder brings to the table. Having someone that intimately understands your product and can create it has a huge impact on how quickly you iterate, especially since they invested in the outcome.

**What is your favorite mobile app?**

I can’t live without Tuex Deux (a dead simple to-do list app) and I’m a little addicted to Instagram and Food Gawker.

**What do you do to help focus?**

I move. If I’m having a hard time focusing or getting started on something I go to the gym, take a yoga class or even just a 15 minute walk. But if the cause of my lack of focus is fatigue - then I take a nap.

This Fall, we’re exploring what’s next in wearables (are you simply carrying your mobile or has the boundaries of your digital life blurred?), what it takes to grow the most-visited website in the publishing industry plus how technology is disrupting (aka creating opportunities for innovators) in the publishing industry. We’re talking with a successful (female) founder who has built, scaled and exited. And we travel to Chicago to meet two innovators from British Airway’s inaugural UnGrounded Flight, then we cross the pond to London to hear what digital business opportunities are being created by tech entrepreneurs in the UK.

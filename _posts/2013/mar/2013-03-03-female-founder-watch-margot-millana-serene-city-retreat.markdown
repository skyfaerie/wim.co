Invite only and exclusively for women, Serene City Retreat is a women's wellness and lifestyle group offering highly curated, novel and luxe experiences. Serene strives to promote and empower women by fostering a community of influential and dynamic women across all industries. Founders Millana Snow and Margot Hanley sat down to answer a few questions for WIM.


__Who inspires you?__

Millana: I am very inspired by my friends, there are many men and women who are famous and have done amazing things that I admire. But my friends, I know their stories. I know the quality of their character and the true stories of their struggle, success and sacrifice. I have amazing friends who are successful in many fields, not only do they inspire me and others by their example, but they have all encouraged and inspired me through many forms of their love and support.

Margot: Margaret Thatcher for her conviction and principle. Coco Chanel because her work was so elegant, simple and revolutionary. And Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin; separately of course, but mostly as a unit.

 
__Why are you an entrepreneur?__

Millana: I cannot see myself being anything but an entrepreneur! All my life it was something that I seemed naturally drawn to. I always believed that I needed to constantly create and explore on my own terms and I believe that being an entrepreneur has allowed me to do that. For me, it is important to be an entrepreneur, because freedom is so important, but also I believe that with freedom comes much responsibility. I wish to constantly grow, expand and share... being an entrepreneur helps me to do so.

Margot: Creating is the primary and most genuine impulse of the human spirit. It’s more valuable when you create with integrity; from your own dreams; with your own hands, mind. Really, what else is the point, if you cannot create life in your own vision? “From this simplest necessity to the highest religious abstraction, from the wheel to the skyscraper, everything we are and we have comes from a single attribute of man -the function of his reasoning mind.” Rand.


__What was a defining moment in your career?__

Millana: I had always wanted to work for VIBE magazine when I was a kid, so when I began working at Uptown magazine and eventually VIBE for my mentor Len Burnett, one of the original co-founders of Vibe I knew this was a dream come true and an opportunity that would help me to make my mark. I should also mention, that my first commercial for Nordstrom Rack was really proof to myself that I could do modeling on a higher level; but when I think about Project Runway I must must admit that it was a very big turning point for me in my personal life and career, one of which I knew that things would never be the same again.

Margot: After I finished defending my honors thesis all of my economics professors and advisors came up to congratulate me. One male professor came up to me, shook my hand, and said “You’ve been consuming information for your entire degree, now, you’ve created some.” That was potent. Also, I would have to say, much of the time when I was studying in Oxford I would look around and feel the historical and institutional memory of the spaces; that exposure to layers and layers of brilliance will continue to inspire me and my career aspirations ad infinitum.


__How is your company different from your competitors?__

Serene is different from its competitors because Serene focuses on curation and making every experience unique- whether it be rooftop yoga, roundtable discussions, dinners or French lessons. Also, our network focuses on bringing together like-minded and dynamic women, from a variety of diverse backgrounds.


__Where do you see your company in the next five years?__


We see a huge network of some of the most influential, visionary and conscious women around the world, coming together to create and expand themselves and the community. We see more and more women being excited about the kind of women they’re connecting with. We see us in more cities, where the economic, political, and social power of women is growing. We see us branching out our product line; finding more and more creative and exciting ways to capture the growing and under appreciated value in the female community.


__What's next for your company?__

We are currently building out our monthly calendar of experiences and memberships for some of New York’s most influential and dynamic women. We’ve just partnered with the fashionable and exclusive SoHo members only club, Parlor for a series Life Drawing experiences, replete with some super sexy male models and DJ Stiletto. We are also working with Elaine Kwon to develop and collaborate on some beautiful “Savour your Senses” experiences for the spring, alongside our rooftop yoga!

 
__How did you finance your business when it was at the early stage?__

We are currently self-funded, but in early stages of speaking with angel and seed investors.

 
__Tell me something about yourself that we don’t know already.__

Millana: I love nature, great food, dancing, dogs and baking. And I listen to Pandora and Abraham-Hicks recordings 24/7.

Margot: I’ve been collecting lists that I have written since I was five; to do lists, wish lists, dinner party lists, Whole Foods shopping lists that I find on the ground. Also, I was born and raised in the midwest; Illinois and then Ohio. Represent.


__What is your guilty pleasure?__

Millana: Talking on the phone for hours with friends. And Liz Lovely chocolate chip cookies!

Margot: Sea salt and almond chocolate; bulky, old-man sweaters; West Wing reruns.

 
__Describe a time you failed. What did you learn from that experience?__

 

Millana: As a model and actress this happens in many forms all the time, by nature of not booking jobs that I really wanted. I have had some casting that I knew were for me, and because of fear, self doubt and judgement I kept myself from the opportunity when in the casting room or even after with my energy. What I have learned over the years from those experiences (and still work on) is to just be myself, to take real joy in being who I am and using every opportunity to have fun and express myself with joy.

Margot: A failure that I remember as being desperately painful was when I was in middle school and auditioned to be an MC for a student talent show. It was in front of the whole school, and you had to kind of make jokes,be super witty, make a little speech. My adversary, Hannah, was just... too good. It reminded me that “success” is not the endgame for every action, every decision, every attempt; these failed attempts may be highly embarrassing, but if you’re never embarrassed some risks you don’t have really a shot at all of living authentically.

 
__What is your favorite mobile app?__

Millana: As I mentioned I listen to Pandora ALL THE TIME! I also really like the WhatsApp for talking with my friends internationally for free which I use almost every day! Oh I like Everest which I just discovered and playing poker on Zynga!

Margot: NPR app, hands down. Diane Rehm, twice a day, every day.

 
__What do you do to help focus?__

Millana: Yoga in my apt, running, cleaning, journaling and writing of positive thoughts... namely a “focus wheel.”

Margot: I go on a run. I listen to something that fundamentally grounds me; classical music, economics podcasts. I write; kind of make jumbles of of brainstorm maps and lists (which I then collect...) And, obviously, loads of coffee.


__What’s your cause?__

Millana: I really want to empower women and believe that young girls who are in the pre-teens are especially in need of empowerment, education and support. I really believe in encouraging people to educate themselves in all areas of thought and to set up positive thinking habits and actions to pursue their dreams.

Margot: Millana and I are (not so secretly…) staging a coup against the male paradigm. Not men, mind you- the paradigm itself. It’s struggling…

 
__Any words of advice for entrepreneurs who are trying to get their ventures launched?__

Millana: Do what you are passionate about and know what is for you! Don’t listen to EVERYTHING people say, even smart and successful people have input that isn’t right for you. So I say listen to your inner guidance/gut and educate yourself to weigh all the information and advice before acting.

Margot: Talk to everyone, anyone. Look at everything and then some. It’s amazing how enlightening a casual conversation with a retail clerk can be; a sculptor; your grandfather; how enlightening an excursion, a second glance, a second inquiry. Talk to the CEO’s, the investors, the powerbrokers. And through this process, bottom line- know and stick to your mission. It’s a fine balance; hearing everything, seeing everything, being open to anything, and holding onto your non-negotiables. My words of advice: Strike that balance.

**An Apple A Month...**

**What’s Behind The Pitch????**

Does the startup community need another pitch event....we didn’t think so, however, we do see the need for a market-focused startup pitch event that provides insights and information on fund raising and financing of startup ventures. And a few others in the startup community think so too: Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator, Dreamit Ventures, Digital Undivided, TiE New York, Astia, New York Angels, Golden Seeds, Xconomy, AlleyWatch, Pipeline Fellowship and others are partnering with us, Third Wave Fashion and New York Tech Women on **Monday, April 22** at AppNexus for our first Behind The Pitch event.  More details (and to RSVP to attend) [here](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/behind-the-pitch-tickets-5552870786).

**Know of a startup that should pitch in front of VCs and Angels at Behind The Pitch? The application is on F6S and the [deadline to apply](http://www.f6s.com/behindthepitch2013) for the opportunity to pitch is March 31.**

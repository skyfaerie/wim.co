Why mobile?


It's a question we're asked a lot at Women Innovate Mobile  - as in "why" would we want to limit our funding focus to mobile or mobile-first ventures.

And if you're sitting in front of your desktop unconvinced, then mull on this: eBay’s global mobile sales reached $13 billion in 2012, more than doubling 2011 global mobile sales, and far exceeding its original $10 billion forecast for 2012.   And for good measure, a few more [eBay-by-the-mobile-numbers](http://internetretailing.net/2013/03/ebay-sets-sights-on-20bn-in-mobile-sales-during-2013/) just for fun:

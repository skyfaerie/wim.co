__What’s the worst mistake a founder can make?__

Choosing the wrong partner or partners.   Yes, compatible personalities and skill sets are important.   Shared work style, financial goals, and time horizons are also important.

 

__What’s the most common Startup error?__

Hiring quickly, firing slowly.  Related:  failing to have a disciplined process for making hiring decisions.

 

__What does “fail fast” mean to you?__

I originally planned to pursue a career in science, and like to think about projects and products as experiments.   Develop a hypothesis and test it.   If it works, fantastic.   If it doesn’t, let it go and move on.

 

__If you could fix one thing in the startup eco-system right now, what would it be?__

I’d love to see more startups recruiting from the huge talent pool of mid-career people who’ve been cut loose by larger firms.  

 

Yes, I know that there’s a cultural gap between large firms and startups.   Some people can leap that gap.   (And a disciplined hiring process would help you to identify them.)

 

__What should startups be focusing on in 2013?__

The notion of “making” is very powerful.  

 

When you’re starting a company, think about “making” the company, itself.   It’s going to be a community.   Make a community that you – and the good people you want to attract – want to live in.  

 

__When’s the right time to seek funding?__

That’s not my bailiwick!   I’ll leave that one to your experts in that area.

 

__Thoughts on crowd-funding?__

Most of us ordinary humans should be heavily invested in index funds.  And especially if we’re in early-stage companies.   Founders and early employees already have enough risk in our financial portfolios.   Or at least, that’s what I learned in b-school.  

 

Prospective founders considering crowd-funding would be smart to start off by creating a project they could fund via Kickstarter.   This would serve as an experiment for what it would be like to execute on a project with a crowd of outside stakeholders watching.

 

__Best advice you’ve ever gotten?__

Send a thank you note.

 

__Guess who’s coming for dinner…who would be your dream dinner guest(s) and why?__

I wish I could have shared a meal with the FDNY’s Captain Patrick Brown, who died on 9/11.   Pat’s life exemplifies triumph over hardship, servant leadership, compassion, a commitment to excellence, and the value of building strong, lifelong relationships.  

 

__Anything else you’d like to add?__

Thank you!
